# Motivation
This repository was created to store my Data Science projects completed during the Data Science MBA at UNOPAR. Thus, all projects were developed with the purpose of applying concepts studied during the MBA program.

## Data Analysis #1 - Sales by Region
This project aims to analyze the sales data of a fictional store, seeking to relate the quantity and total value of sales by region. The analysis includes visualization charts and correlation calculation to explore the relationship between the quantity of sales and the total sales value across different regions.

**Note:** The data used is fictional and was generated by ChatGPT.

### Technologies Used
- Python: Main language of the project
- Pandas and Numpy: Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib: Data visualization
- Scipy: Spearman correlation calculation
- Collections (Counter, defaultdict): Data counting and aggregation

### Graph Results and Correlation Analysis
